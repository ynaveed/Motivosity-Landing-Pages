    “What I love about Motivosity, and why it's a unique experience in my
    career, is that every day we get this huge amount of appreciation from our
    customers and their employees. Every day I'm grateful that we can do
    something that makes people happier to be where they are"       Scott
    Johnson Founder & CEO. Motivosity
  description_one: >-
    Life is short and we spend a lot of our waking hours in the ofﬁce. We think
    that life at work can and should be just as meaningful and satisifying as
    life off the clock. Everything we do is designed to lead to this end.
  description_two: >-
    We're called "MVers” [moovers] and yes, we’re a small group of people who
    aim to move the world. Each one of us at Motivosity is here primarily
    because they care improving the value of the workplace in people's lives.
